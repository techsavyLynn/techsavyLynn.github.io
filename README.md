## 🧠 About Me

I'm a **Data & Insights Manager** with a curious mind and an allergic reaction to boring dashboards. I live at the intersection of analytics, storytelling, and strategy, where charts make sense and spreadsheets cry tears of joy.

I believe that data is like a teenager – messy, misunderstood, and full of potential. My job? Translate that mess into meaningful action.
